Monolith is an HTML-focused CSS framework, which means you will spend as little time as possible memorizing CSS classes, and instead write your HTML and get the expected result of a modern UI element, i.e. a button or input field.

The framework emphasizes…

* **Configuration:** The framework comes with a configuration file that you can update with your intended brand attributes,
   including colors, typography, grid, forms, and more.
* **Semantics:** HTML that is ~opinionated~ logical and written with accessibility in mind. 
* **Modularity:** The struggle with frameworks is they are usually dependent on being your core stylesheet. Monolith is specifically designed to be scoped and controlled as an alternative, to existing projects.
* **Fast & Furious:** After reading the wiki and taking a little time to understand the component structure, you should be able to hit the ground running, aka, never need to read the docs again. :)

Currently there are only a few core pieces. Plans are under way to flesh out even more in future versions. Stay tuned! Until then, check out the rest of this guide for a crash course in Monolith’s offerings.
