# Roadmap

Below is a brief overview of the future concerns of Undernet. If you have any suggestions or think this list could be more complete, feel free to create an issue explaining the feature/change. Thanks!

1. **Themes**: Considering this is a front-end framework, it only makes sense to allow for more concrete examples of what can be done in the real world. Currently, the only real example is the website itself.

2. **Performance**: One of the primary goals of Undernet is to leave a small footprint. To that end, if there's a way to further reduce bundle size, it'll be done!

3. **Modulization**: In an ES module world, it only makes sense to provide the most modern interface and dependency management possible. You should only need to grab exactly what you want, and nothing else.
