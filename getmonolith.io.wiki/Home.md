Monolith is a front-end framework offering a flexible starting point for new web projects. It includes base styling for most common `html` tags, including button, form, link, and typography elements. Also including is a flex-based grid and several helper classes.

In addition to styling, Monolith also includes interactive components. Currently there are two: a modal and accordion component. They are easy to use and rely only on a script call and the correct markup structure. More components are planned!

Monolith's CSS and JavaScript will work in recent versions of these browsers:

* Chrome ✓
* Firefox ✓
* Safari ✓
* Microsoft Edge ✓

With support for Internet Explorer 11 as well.

The framework has four core tenets:

* **Configuration:** The framework comes with a configuration file that you can update with your intended brand attributes, including colors, typography, grid, forms, and more.
* **Semantics:** HTML that is logical and written with accessibility in mind.
* **Modularity:** The struggle with frameworks is they are usually dependent on being your core stylesheet. Monolith is specifically designed to be scoped and controlled as an alternative, to existing projects.
* **Agility:** Because all that's needed is an understanding of semantic HTML and customizing SCSS in the beginning, you will quickly get to building without worrying about tons of custom styling/javascript.
