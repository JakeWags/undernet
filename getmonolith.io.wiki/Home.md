Monolith is a front-end framework offering a flexible starting point for new web projects.

It includes base styling for common tags, including buttons, forms, and typography. Also included is a flexbox grid and a handful of helper classes.

In addition to styling, Monolith also includes interactive components. Currently there are two: a modal and accordion component. They are easy to use and rely only on a script call, e.g., `Monolith.accordions.start()`, and the correct markup structure. More components to arrive soon!

What makes Monolith stand apart from other frameworks like Bootstrap, Bulma, or Foundation? Truthfully, Monolith started as an experiment to learn the ins and outs of CSS. Since last year, it has evolved into a functioning library that takes the best of many frameworks and puts it all into one easy-to-use package. It is highly configurable and even has namespace-able CSS. Monolith is still young, but I hope folks can use it, break it, and help improve it!

Monolith's CSS and JavaScript will work in recent versions of these browsers:

- Chrome ✓
- Firefox ✓
- Safari ✓
- Microsoft Edge ✓

Monolith also fully supports Internet Explorer 11.

The framework has four core tenets:

- **Configuration:** The framework emphasizes customization and configuration to give the most power to the developer. It's best used for static websites, but can still be used for other contexts such as React or Rails apps.
- **Semantics:** Monolith encourages accessible and useable interface development. All JavaScript components have accessibility baked in without much required from the developer.
- **Modularity:** The struggle with frameworks is they are usually dependent on being your core stylesheet. Monolith is specifically designed to be scoped and controlled as an alternative, to existing projects.
- **Agility:** Start building without worrying about tons of custom styling/javascript.
