Monolith is an HTML-focused CSS framework, which means you will spend as little time as possible memorizing CSS classes, and instead customize SCSS variables/maps, then write your HTML and get the expected result of a modern UI element, i.e. a button or input field.

Also included are two common interactive UI components: modals and accordions. More on the way soon!

The framework emphasizes…

* **Configuration:** The framework comes with a configuration file that you can update with your intended brand attributes, including colors, typography, grid, forms, and more.
* **Semantics:** HTML that is logical and written with accessibility in mind.
* **Modularity:** The struggle with frameworks is they are usually dependent on being your core stylesheet. Monolith is specifically designed to be scoped and controlled as an alternative, to existing projects.
* **Agility:** Because all that's needed is an understanding of semantic HTML and customizing SCSS in the beginning, you will quickly get to building without worrying about tons of custom styling/javascript.
